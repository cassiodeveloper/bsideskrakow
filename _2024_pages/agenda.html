I’ll discuss how this diagnosis helped me finally understand why I struggled with focus, motivation, and other challenges for so long. You’ll also learn about ADHD in general, why there is a high representation of neurodiverse individuals in infosec, and why that’s a strength! My aim is to break down taboos, normalize conversations about mental health challenges, and stress the importance of transparency—especially with employers—before it’s too late and you’re let go (again). If any of this resonates with you, trust me, you’re not alone. At my talk, you’ll be among others who may be facing similar challenges. My hope is that by sharing my story and experiences, you’ll find something that helps you on your own journey.</i></td>
