        <p>In order to sponsor BSides Kraków, you must be aware of what we need as a non-profit communuty driven conference and what you want as a company.</p>
        <p>Here are a few points to consider:
            <ul>
                <li>Our main goal with the sponsorship program, is that you provide activities / content to the participants.</li>
                <li>We do not make profit of any kind, all the money collected is invested in the conference for the current year.</li>
                <li>There are options of sponsorship without any kind of payment.</li>
                <li>We need the money on a deadline of maximum 2 months before the conference, we need to pay for T-shirts production, catering, after-party, badges etc. All these suppliers take time to provide their services.</li>
                <li>If your company has a policy of 30 days payment for example, the whole process of signing contract until we get the payment must be done to assure the payment by 60 days prior to the conference date.</li>
                <li>We <b>NEVER</b> share participants personal data, you can create your own activity during the conference for that and those who want to, can provide you their personal data such as name, email etc.</li>
            </ul>    
        </p>
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>After filling the form, we will get in touch with you to setup an initial call to clarify all points needed. Then, we send you our contract template, after agreeing we sign and we generate an invoice that you can pay. After payment done, we start processing the activities mentioned on our side.</p>
