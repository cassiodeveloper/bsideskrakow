          Code-of-Conduct</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">Security BSides Athens is a conference by the
          information security community, for the information security
          community. Facilitating a pleasant atmosphere for all attendees is a
          core aim of the Security BSides Athens organisers and as an
          attendee/participant you agree to be bound by the Security BSides
          Athens Attendee Code-of-Conduct.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="section-header">Purpose of this Code-of-Conduct: </h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;To ensure a constructive,
          inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for all volunteers and attendees of
          the Security BSides Athens conference.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;To ensure that all participants
          know what behaviour they have a right to expect from other attendees,
          volunteers and organisers.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;To ensure that all participants
          know what behaviour is expected of them whilst attending the Security
          BSides Athens conference.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="section-header">Respect for Others</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">Attendees will:</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Treat the organisers and
          volunteers with respect and follow any instructions given. The BSides
          Athens volunteers and organisers have given up a significant amount of
          time to facilitate this conference for the benefit of the attendees.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Respect the presenters, do not
          talk among yourselves during their presentations, ensure your mobile
          phones are muted or switched off once you are attending a
          presentation, avoid leaving until the end of the presentation, as to
          minimize disruption to the other attendees and the presenter. Heckling
          and constant harassment of presenters will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Asking questions is what makes
          this a great community, but do respect the presenter’s method for
          handling questions (e.g. do not interrupt to comment or jump to ask a
          question if the presenter prefers questions at the end of the session)
          and do not monopolise the presenter/speaker (be concious of time and
          allow other attendees the opportunity to ask questions as well).</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Treat all present at the
          conference fairly and equally.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Do not discriminate unlawfully
          against any person.</p>
        <p class="lead text-muted">&bull;&nbsp;Allow others to express
          themselves and understand that all views are important even if they
          are not the same as your own - as long as no offence is caused even if
          that is unintentionl.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="section-header">Photographs and Recordings</h2>
        <p class="lead text-muted">We will be taking photographs during the
          whole event and we will be video-recording the sessions for both
          promotional and knowledge-sharing purposes. By signing up to the event
          (attending), you consent with Security BSides Athens to share such
          media to its online (social media platforms) and offline communication
          channels.</p>
