  <p>Security BSides Kraków is a conference by the
    information security community, for the information security
    community. Facilitating a pleasant atmosphere for all Participants is
    a core aim of the Security BSides Kraków organisers and as an
    Participant/participant you agree to be bound by the Security BSides
    Kraków Participant Code-of-Conduct.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Purpose of this Code-of-Conduct: </h2>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;To ensure a constructive,
    inclusive and pleasant atmosphere for all volunteers and Participants
    of the Security BSides Kraków conference.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;To ensure that all participants
    know what behaviour they have a right to expect from other
    Participants, volunteers and organisers.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;To ensure that all participants
    know what behaviour is expected of them whilst attending the Security
    BSides Kraków conference.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Respect for Others</h2>
  <p>Participants will:</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Treat the organisers and
    volunteers with respect and follow any instructions given. The BSides
    Kraków volunteers and organisers have given up a significant amount of
    time to facilitate this conference for the benefit of the
    Participants.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Respect the presenters, do not
    talk among yourselves during their presentations, ensure your mobile
    phones are muted or switched off once you are attending a
    presentation, avoid leaving until the end of the presentation, as to
    minimize disruption to the other Participants and the presenter.
    Heckling and constant harassment of presenters will not be tolerated.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Asking questions is what makes
    this a great community, but do respect the presenter’s method for
    handling questions (e.g. do not interrupt to comment or jump to ask a
    question if the presenter prefers questions at the end of the session)
    and do not monopolise the presenter/speaker (be concious of time and
    allow other Participants the opportunity to ask questions as well).</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Treat all present at the conference fairly and equally.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Do not discriminate unlawfully against any person.</p>
  <p>&bull;&nbsp;Allow others to express
    themselves and understand that all views are important even if they
    are not the same as your own - as long as no offence is caused even if
    that is unintentionl.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Photographs and Recordings</h2>
  <p>We will be taking photographs during the
    whole event and we will be video-recording the sessions for both
    promotional and knowledge-sharing purposes. By signing up to the event
    (attending), you consent with Security BSides Kraków to share such
    media to its online (social media platforms) and offline communication
    channels.</p>
