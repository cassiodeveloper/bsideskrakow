  info: "Offensive Operations Against Foreign Adversaries: Russia <br />  What if you were part of a State-sponsored hacking group, tasked with gaining access to a Russian defense contractor network? What high-value targets could you identify from an external, unauthenticated perspective using advanced OSINT techniques? How would you gain an initial foothold on an operating system that uses a foreign language? Can you enumerate compromised systems with your current tooling and operate in a new software ecosystem devoid of traditional Active Directory? What valuable information could you find and exfiltrate to achieve mission success? In the end, do you profit from your access or burn it all to the ground? Join us as we take you on a journey as a State-sponsored hacker pivoting through Russian defense networks."
