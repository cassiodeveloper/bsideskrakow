  description: I am a DevOps engineer with over 13 years of experience in IT, DevOps, and DevSecOps.I have designed, built hands-on, and secured complex Cloud & On-Prem projects in startups and corporates.It started from the Stone era when people deployed servers in racks. Creating infrastructure end to end, from the cable level up to the application level, was an immense privilege. In my last role, I led a group of DevOps engineers at Microsoft. Microsoft was one of the companies attacked by the Solarwinds attack, and my team was part of the incident response group. After that, we figured out that we are not protected from such future attacks - And so I started Myrror to tackle that problem.I'm a cat enthusiast, and in my non-existent spare time, I play the drums and some soccer.
