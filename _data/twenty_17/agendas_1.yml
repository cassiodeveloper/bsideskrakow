  info3: "<u>Chessboard of War: Breaching the perimeter on physical cyber security engagements</u><br><b>Tayla Micael Sellschop</b><br><i>This presentation is designed to illustrate to participants the functioning of physical assessments in real-world scenarios. It delves into the conceptual and practical methodologies employed by offensive security analysts in gaining entry to a building and utilizing that access for subsequent internal exploits. This presentation additionally provides insights on optimal strategies to safeguard against external threats and enhance employee awareness regarding the risks associated with insufficient physical security measures on their premises. Attendees will leave with three key insights. Firstly, an understanding of the psychology behind social engineering and its dynamics within different cultural contexts. Secondly, awareness of various tools, including Raspberry Pi's, keyloggers, and card cloners, commonly employed in engagements. Lastly, they will gain knowledge of best practices, highlighting how organizations can fortify their physical security and enhance awareness to protect themselves.</i>"
