From sharing production secrets through insecure channels, to disregarding TLS server certificate validation. These are symptoms of a larger issue - 'Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security'. In this talk we will delve into the heart of this issue and show why adopting a developer-first approach is paramount when designing a secure system. We will distill design best-practices, from prominent and successful opensource projects such as Let's Encrypt and Sigstore. We contrast these with real-world scenarios, observed during security assessments in the industry, and show how the same best-practices could have lead to a system with higher adoption and therefore better security posture. Participants will be equipped with actionable strategies suited for simple scripts as well as complex CI/CD systems.</i>"

Our research began with an investigation into Ubuntu’s privilege boundaries, focusing on DBus and its interaction with the cups printing system. Through a series of methodical steps, we uncovered a way to escalate privileges from a standard user to root by chaining together minor bugs and existing features. Our journey highlights the importance of understanding system components and their interactions. By exploiting the configurations within the cups service and bypassing AppArmor restrictions, we achieved arbitrary command execution, ultimately gaining root access through the wpa_supplicant service. This talk emphasizes the significance of a holistic approach to security research, demonstrating how combining knowledge of system features can lead to successful exploitation. Attendees will gain insights into advanced privilege escalation techniques and the critical role of comprehensive system analysis in identifying security risks.</i>"

  info3: "<u>Improving security with Kubernetes</u><br><b>Pedro Dallegrave</b><br><i>The idea behind this presentation is to present the challenges of vulnerability management and security hardening for cloud environments that leverage instance-based deployments, such as AWS EC2, that host stateless services and are constantly being scaled in and out. This presentation is based on a real-life scenario in which the golden image approach is used in combination with a slight amount of automation to ensure patching is performed. It highlights the pushback received from developers who want to avoid live patching as well as business pressure that doesn't want to have engineers allocated to tasks that are not directly related to feature development. A technical description of the current setup will be presented along with a service diagram. The proposed solution then uses a containerized environment, in this case, Kubernetes, but any other orchestration solution, like Nomad, for example, can use it. Two use cases will be presented for the solution: one based on a Jenkins deployment, which is mainly a static instance, and the second a random service that scales from 1-2 instances to up to 20 to satisfy demand. The amount of configuration and effort required to maintain them will be compared with running the same setup in Kubernetes, and these changes can considerably reduce the effort required from engineering teams to maintain the services. Examples of the benefits that can be achieved are: - There is no need to manage operating system updates or patches for dozens of services that are embedded into the OS or added for convenience. - Simplification of build and deployment processes - Ability to ensure everything is up-to-date from build to operation phase - Stricter hardening of the whole environment by reducing the number of required packages, restricting access, removing services like SSH, etc. - Leveraging a centralized access control mechanism</i>"
