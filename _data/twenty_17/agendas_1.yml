It delves into the conceptual and practical methodologies employed by offensive security analysts in gaining entry to a building and utilizing that access for subsequent internal exploits. This presentation additionally provides insights on optimal strategies to safeguard against external threats and enhance employee awareness regarding the risks associated with insufficient physical security measures on their premises. Attendees will leave with three key insights. Firstly, an understanding of the psychology behind social engineering and its dynamics within different cultural contexts. Secondly, awareness of various tools, including Raspberry Pi's, keyloggers, and card cloners, commonly employed in engagements. Lastly, they will gain knowledge of best practices, highlighting how organizations can fortify their physical security and enhance awareness to protect themselves.</i>"

  info3: "<u>Improving security with Kubernetes</u><br><b>Pedro Dallegrave</b><br><i>The idea behind this presentation is to present the challenges of vulnerability management and security hardening for cloud environments that leverage instance-based deployments, such as AWS EC2, that host stateless services and are constantly being scaled in and out. This presentation is based on a real-life scenario in which the golden image approach is used in combination with a slight amount of automation to ensure patching is performed. It highlights the pushback received from developers who want to avoid live patching as well as business pressure that doesn't want to have engineers allocated to tasks that are not directly related to feature development. A technical description of the current setup will be presented along with a service diagram. The proposed solution then uses a containerized environment, in this case, Kubernetes, but any other orchestration solution, like Nomad, for example, can use it. Two use cases will be presented for the solution: one based on a Jenkins deployment, which is mainly a static instance, and the second a random service that scales from 1-2 instances to up to 20 to satisfy demand. The amount of configuration and effort required to maintain them will be compared with running the same setup in Kubernetes, and these changes can considerably reduce the effort required from engineering teams to maintain the services. Examples of the benefits that can be achieved are: - There is no need to manage operating system updates or patches for dozens of services that are embedded into the OS or added for convenience. - Simplification of build and deployment processes - Ability to ensure everything is up-to-date from build to operation phase - Stricter hardening of the whole environment by reducing the number of required packages, restricting access, removing services like SSH, etc. - Leveraging a centralized access control mechanism</i>"

The first use cases were quick to follow: new applications based on generative AI are being deployed in production every day. In this brand-new field, the race has begun between developers and security experts on the one hand, and attackers on the other. What are the risks of applications using LLMs? What practical means do developers have to protect themselves? This is what I'm going to talk about in this talk, explaining:<br />- how LLMs and the applications that leverage them work <br />- typical vulnerabilities in applications using generative AI (with juicy stories to back it up) <br />- countermeasures developers can take to protect their applications</i>"
