  info: "<b>Offensive Operations Against Foreign Adversaries: Russia</b> <br />What if you were part of a State-sponsored hacking group, tasked with gaining access to a Russian defense contractor network? What high-value targets could you identify from an external, unauthenticated perspective using advanced OSINT techniques? How would you gain an initial foothold on an operating system that uses a foreign language? Can you enumerate compromised systems with your current tooling and operate in a new software ecosystem devoid of traditional Active Directory? What valuable information could you find and exfiltrate to achieve mission success? In the end, do you profit from your access or burn it all to the ground? Join us as we take you on a journey as a State-sponsored hacker pivoting through Russian defense networks."

  info: "<b>Introduction to Python w/ Joff Thyer</b> <br />16-hour course<br />Includes Certificate of participation and 6 months access to the course on-demand<br />One of the most pressing needs Information Security professionals face today is the need to automate their work in both the attack, and defense context. Skills gained for automating tasks in programming languages are critical to scale up the efforts of a limited security professional talent pool. For example, it is not uncommon to find useful Python scripts on the Internet that are at a Proof-of-Concept stage to quickly achieve some information security professional goal. Penetration testers, incident responders, forensics, and defense professionals need the ability to be able to take existing code and produce stable functional Python tools or be able to debug an issue with an existing tool. This course aims to teach the fundamentals of the Python programming language such that a student will gain a beginning to intermediate level of competency with the language. Labs will be presented in a Capture the Flag (CTF) style format as well as some more comprehensive programming tasks.The expectation as to whether students can complete all exercises is dependent on prior student experience, and knowledge. Python is a language that is best approached if a student has some elementary programming background (such as shell scripting for example).<br /><ul><li>About Python</li><li>Python Shell</li><li>Strings, Input, Output</li><li>Writing your First Script</li><li>Code Blocks, Indentation</li><li>Functions</li><li>Conditional Logic</li><li>Lists</li><li>Loops</li><li>Modules</li><li>Dictionaries</li><li>Files and Databases</li><li>File Handling</li><li>Requests</li><li>Classes</li><li>Exception Handling</li><li>Regular Expressions</li><li>Furthering your Journey</li></ul>"
  instructor: "<b>Joff Thyer</b> has been a penetration tester and security analyst with Black Hills Information Security since 2013. Prior to joining the InfoSec world, he had a long career in the IT industry as a systems administrator and an enterprise network architect. He has an Associate’s in Computer Science, a B.S. in Mathematics, and an M.S. in Computer Science, as well as several certifications. The best part of a penetration test for Joff is developing sophisticated malware that tackles defensive solutions, ultimately delivering exciting wins for company engagements. He has extensive experience covering intrusion prevention/detection systems, infrastructure defense, vulnerability analysis, defense bypass, source code analysis, and exploit research. When Joff isn’t working or co-hosting the Security Weekly podcast, he enjoys making music and woodworking."
